ABSTRACT:
Human health monitoring has become increasingly important in the modern era, with 
wearable technology playing a pivotal role in providing real-time data for medical 
professionals and individuals alike. This paper presents the development of a wearable 
health monitoring system utilizing sensors integrated into a custom-designed printed 
circuit board (PCB). The system incorporates various biosensors such as heart rate, body 
temperature, electrocardiogram (ECG), and accelerometers to monitor vital physiological 
parameters. The PCB design ensures minimal power consumption, compactness, and ease 
of integration into wearable devices, while maintaining reliability and accuracy in sensor 
readings. Data collected by the sensors is processed and transmitted wirelessly to mobile 
devices or healthcare platforms for further analysis. The proposed system aims to provide 
continuous, non-invasive monitoring, offering potential benefits in the early detection of 
health issues, personalized healthcare, and chronic disease management. Through the use 
of innovative PCB design and sensor integration, this approach enhances the accessibility 
and practicality of wearable health monitoring systems for everyday use.

OBJECTIVE:
The primary objective of this project is to design and develop a wearable health 
monitoring system that integrates various biosensors into a compact, efficient, and 
reliable printed circuit board (PCB). To integrate multiple health-monitoring sensors 
such as heart rate, body temperature, electrocardiogram (ECG), and motion sensors 
(accelerometer) onto a single PCB for continuous and real-time tracking of vital 
health parameters. To create a custom PCB that optimizes space, minimizes power 
consumption, and ensures stability, enabling its use in portable and wearable 
devices. To design a system that can wirelessly transmit collected health data to 
mobile devices or cloud-based healthcare platforms for analysis, ensuring real-time 
monitoring and alerts.
